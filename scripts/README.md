## Additional scripts

**NOTE 1**: these files are not required to reproduce results.
You can directly download the already processed txt files by following the instructions in the README at the root folder of this project.

**NOTE 2**: these files are "*research code quality*" so they are not clean, can be hard to understand, and may include a lot of debug and dead code.

- `csv2txt.py` is used after running the original CLUTRR generation script (https://github.com/facebookresearch/clutrr) in order to convert csv files into txt files with the proof format used in this work.
- `csv2txt.sh` is an example of how to use `csv2txt.py`.
